I am currently working on exciting Nuxt projects as a lead frontend developer with the startup [Hormur](https://hormur.com) but also on a (*at least*) ground-breaking tool for the management of public displays for cultural events steming from my PhD [Kronikle](https://kronikle.eu).

I was a Ph.D. student in Lyon at [LIRIS](http://liris.cnrs.fr/) in the [SICAL](http://liris.cnrs.fr/equipes?id=73) team. I was working on the [PLACED project](http://www.placedproject.eu) under the supervision of [Aurélien Tabard](http://www.tabard.fr) and [Clemens Klokmose](https://www.klokmose.net). My Ph.D. focused on designing Place-Centric Digital Services, and more specifically interactive public displays in libraries. [You may find my thesis here.](/files/Alix_thesis_compressed.pdf)

My previous experiences involved UX design and JavaScript full-stack development on the project [Bibliotouch](https://bibliotouch.enssib.fr) (joint project between [Yunow](https://yunow.io//) and [ENSSIB](https://www.enssib.fr)).

I graduated with a Masters degree in Human-Computer Interaction (UX Research & Design) from [Université Paris Sud](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/m2-interaction-human-computer-interaction-hci#presentation-m2) with honors.

My tool of predilection is now JavaScript for both front- and back-end, but I also have prior professional experience with Java and C++ development.
