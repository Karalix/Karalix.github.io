I am a Ph.D. student in the department on Computer Science at the Université de Lyon, France. I am currently working on the [PLACED project](www.placedproject.eu) under the direction of [Aurélien Tabard](www.tabard.fr). My previous experience involved UX design and JavaScript full-stack development on the project [Bibliotouch](https://github.com/biinlab/bibliotouch) (joint project between [Biin](www.biin.fr) and [ENSSIB](www.enssib.fr)).

I graduated with a Masters degree in Human-Computer Interaction from [Université Paris Sud](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/m2-interaction-human-computer-interaction-hci#presentation-m2) with honors. My tool of predilection is now JavaScript for both front and backend, but I also have prior professional experience in Java, C# and C++ development.
