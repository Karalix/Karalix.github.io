I am a Ph.D. student in Lyon at [LIRIS](http://liris.cnrs.fr/) in the [SICAL](http://liris.cnrs.fr/equipes?id=73) team. I am currently working on the [PLACED project](http://www.placedproject.eu) under the direction of [Aurélien Tabard](http://www.tabard.fr). My Ph.D. focuses on distributed public ambient displays, how to prototype them and their use in PLACED.

My previous experiences involved UX design and JavaScript full-stack development on the project [Bibliotouch](https://github.com/biinlab/bibliotouch) (joint project between [Biin](http://www.biin.fr) and [ENSSIB](http://www.enssib.fr)).

I graduated with a Masters degree in Human-Computer Interaction from [Université Paris Sud](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/m2-interaction-human-computer-interaction-hci#presentation-m2) with honors. My tool of predilection is now JavaScript for both front- and back-end, but I also have prior professional experience with Java and C++ development.
